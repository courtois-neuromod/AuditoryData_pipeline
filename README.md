# Auditory-test data management pipeline

Psychology Master's auditory-test data processing project

## Project Definition

### Project background

This data processing pipeline has been developed to be used with the auditory tests data acquired through the Projet Courtois NeuroMod.
This neuroimaging data acquisition project takes place at the Unité de neuroimagerie fonctionnelle (UNF) of the Centre de recherche de l'Institut universitaire de gériatrie de Montréal (CRIUGM).
The Projet Courtois NeuroMod is a longitudinal MRI (functional and anatomical) data acquisition project where participants (6) are scanned on a weekly basis for a period of six years.
One risk associated with intensive protocols like this one is the participants' chronic exposure to high noise levels during the scan sessions.
This is why it is important to regularly monitor their auditory health to ensure that the research protocol is not causing any damage to the participants' hearing.
Part of the project's auditory perception research team job was to administer this monitoring protocol.
To do so, the participants went through different clinical audiology tests every month to keep track of the evolution of their auditory health.
This particular processing pipeline started out as a project for the 2021 edition of BrainHack School.
Following that first development milestone, other functionalities were gradually added to the pipeline.

### Data

The dataset used for this project has been acquired through multiple sessions with each participant between November 2018 and June 2022.
Multiple clinical tests were performed including:
<ul>
    <li>Otoscopic inspection of the external auditory canal and tympanic membrane</li>
    <li>Tympanometry</li>
    <li>Stapedial reflex test</li>
    <li>Pure-tone audiometry</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Regular/clinical frequency range (250 Hz - 8 kHz)</li>
            <li>Extended/Ultra-high frequency range (9 - 20 kHz)</li>
        </ul>
    <li>Matrix speech-in-noise perception test</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Primary language of the participant: French or English (for all participants)</li>
            <li>Secondary language of the participant: French or English (for 5 out of the 6 participants)</li>
        </ul>
    <li>Otoacoustic emissions</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Transiant-evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE)</li>
            <li>Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) with an L1/L2 ratio of 65/55 dB SPL</li>
            <li>DPOAE Growth function (DP Growth) for 2 kHz, 4 kHz and 6 kHz</li>
        </ul>
</ul>

Baseline data were acquired for each of these tests when the participants joined the project (November 2018 - July 2019) and at the beginning of the monitoring protocol (January - February 2021).
Three different combinations of those tests were then designed as experimental conditions and a random sequence of conditions was assigned to each participant.
The specific dataset used in this pipeline includes results from the tympanometry test, the stapedial reflex test, the pure-tone audiometry, the otoacoustic emission tests and the Matrix speech-in-noise perception test.

### Data formating (BIDS format)

The important amount of data generated by this protocol came in a wide variety of formats.
To be able to manage, process and analyse efficiently that data, an automated processing pipeline was needed.
The first task that needed to be done was to transform each of the differents formats in a common format.
Since the neuroimaging community already has a formating standard (the Brain imaging data structure: BIDS), the best way to be able to include this dataset into the CNeuroMod's already existing BIDS compatible dataset would be to try to adapt the BIDS format to this new kind of data.
To do so, a first python script will take a raw, spreadsheet formated dataset and automatically create a BIDS format database.

### Graph generation (Pure-tone audiometry, Matrix speech-in-noise perception test and OAE tests)

For some of these tests, such as the pure-tone audiometry test, the data is more easily interpreted when rendered into graphic displays.
The second task to be done is to build python scripts to generate the interactive html graphs using the Plot.ly library.

## How to use the AuditoryData_pipeline

### Raw data format

To be able to be processed by this pipeline, data from different types of auditory tests must be regrouped in a spreadsheet ([a Google spreadsheet template is available here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aKakQJvJnvPUouTUciGm3FMlnNAGIX8NXhulbhjq9d4/edit?usp=sharing): PLEASE START BY MAKING YOUR OWN COPY / DO NOT EDIT THIS TEMPLATE!!!). The pipeline supports the use of a link to a Google spreadsheet (manually input when prompted or stored in the cell right below "test_database" in a .tsv file: "[repo_root]/data/URL.tsv") or the use of an Office Excel spreadsheet file version of the template: "[repo_root]/data/test_database.xlsx". This spreadsheet covers the following tests:

<ul>
    <li>Tympanometry</li>
    <li>Stapedial reflex test</li>
    <li>Pure-tone audiometry</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Regular/clinical frequency range (250 and 500 Hz, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8 kHz)</li>
        <li>Extended/Ultra-high frequency range (9, 10, 11.2, 12.5, 14, 16, 18 and 20 kHz)</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Matrix speech-in-noise perception test</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Primary language (French or English)</li>
        <li>Secondary language (French or English)</li>
        <li>Conditions:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Practice sequence (Stimulus: bilateral, Noise: bilateral)</li>
            <li>Sequence #1 (Stimulus: bilateral, Noise: bilateral)</li>
            <li>Sequence #2 (Stimulus: left, Noise: bilateral)</li>
            <li>Sequence #3 (Stimulus: right, Noise: bilateral)</li>
            <li>Sequence #4 (Stimulus: left, Noise: left)</li>
            <li>Sequence #5 (Stimulus: right, Noise: right)</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
</ul>

The OAE test (TEOAE, DPOAE and DPOAE growth function) results must be exported as .csv files from the acquisition software (i.e., ILOv6) and saved in the "[repo_root]/data/auditory_tests/OAE/" folder. Each file name should include the following informations (separated by underscores):

<ul>
    <li>The participant's ID: sub-XX (01 to 06)</li>
    <li>The test date and condition:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Baseline: YYYY-MM-DD-Baseline</li>
        <li>Pre-scan condition: YYYY-MM-DD-PreScan</li>
        <li>Post-scan condition: YYYY-MM-DD-PostScan</li>
        <li>Delayed condition: YYYY-MM-DD-2POST</li>
    </ul>
    <li>The type of test:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>TEOAE: TE</li>
        <li>DPOAE: DPOAE6555</li>
        <li>DPOAE Growth function: DPGrowth-X000 (2000, 4000 or 6000)</li>
    </ul>
    <li>The tested ear:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Left ear: L</li>
        <li>Right ear: R</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Finish with the file extension: .csv</li>
</ul>

**The overall filename should look like this: *sub-01_1900-01-01-Baseline_DPOAE_L.csv*.**

### Required Python libraries

In addition to Python 3, several free libraries are necessary for the pipeline to work.
You will need the following libraries (and their dependencies):

<ul>
    <li>colorama</li>
    <li>matplotlib</li>
    <li>notebook</li>
    <li>numpy</li>
    <li>pandas</li>
    <li>plotly</li>
    <li>seaborn</li>
    <li>scikit-learn</li>
</ul>

If needed, a virtual environment setup procedure including all the required libraries is available in the next section.

### Virtual environment

#### Initial setup

To create a Python virtual environment already equiped with all the necessary libraries, follow these steps:

<ol>
    <li>Open your terminal</li>
    <li>Navigate to the AuditoryData_pipeline folder</li>
    <li>At the root of the AuditoryData_pipeline folder, copy/paste the following code line in your terminal (don't forget to insert the name of your environment), then press enter</li>
</ol>

```
$ python3 -m venv [name of your new virtual environment folder]
```

Your terminal should now install the virtual environment.
When the process is done, a new folder named in accord with what you specified in the command should have been created at the root of your AuditoryData_pipeline folder.

#### Environment activation and deactivation

To activate your Python virtual environment, follow these steps:

<ol>
    <li>Open your terminal</li>
    <li>Navigate to the AuditoryData_pipeline folder</li>
    <li>At the root of the AuditoryData_pipeline folder, copy/paste the following code line in your terminal (don't forget to insert the name of your environment), then press enter</li>
</ol>

```
$ source [name of the virtual environment folder]/bin/activate
```

Your virtual environment should now be activated (the name of your environment should now show between parenthesis in front of the name of your system's name in the terminal command line).

To deactivate your virtual environment, simply input the following command and press enter

```
$ deactivate
```

### Library and pipeline software installation

In order to run the pipeline, you will now have to install the dependencies and the pipeline's local package (in your virtual environment or your entire computer's system according to your needs).
To do so, follow these steps:

<ol>
    <li>Open your terminal</li>
    <li>Navigate to the AuditoryData_pipeline folder</li>
    <li>At the root of the AuditoryData_pipeline folder, copy/paste the following code line (dependency installation), and press enter</li>
    <code>$ pip install -r requirements.txt</code>
    <li>At the root of the AuditoryData_pipeline folder, copy/paste the following code line (AuditoryData_pipeline software installation), and press enter</li>
</ol>

```
$ pip install .
```

It will run the setup.py script and install the AuditoryData_pipeline as a local package.

### Data placement

For the software to be able to properly retrieve the data, it has to be located at the right place.
As mentionned in the "Raw data format" section, the AuditoryData_pipeline uses two types of raw data files: .csv files for the OAE tests and a spreadsheet for the other tests.

<ul>
    <li>The OAE .csv files (with properly formated file names) must be located inside the [repo_root]/auditory_tests/OAE/ folder.</li>
    <li>The other tests' spreadsheet can be locally placed in the [repo_root]/data/ folder (named *test_database.xslx*) or a link to a Google Spreadsheet can be automatically (using the *URL.tsv* file located in the [repo_root]/data/ folder) or manually (copied/pasted in the terminal when prompted) input.</li>
</ul>

### Run the AuditoryData_pipeline

To run the software, simply navigate to the root of your repository, input the following command and press enter

```
$ python AuditoryData_pipeline.py
```

You will see the pipeline's main menu appear and will be able to choose which functionality you wish to use.
